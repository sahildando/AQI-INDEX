## Introduction

This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on historical air quality data. The models are trained on the [Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india) dataset and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
